The poison was supposed to kill him. However, the poison instead turned him into a small child. Shinichi adopts a new identity as Conan Edogawa, and lives with his girlfriend, Ran Mouri, and her father, Detective Kogoro Mori, under the pretense that his parents are away and unable to take care of him. As a child, Shinichi/Conan helps Kogorou solve murder cases, while trying to find the evil men who poisoned him, to steal the poison and create an antidote. </p>
